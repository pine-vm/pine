# 2019-02 Deploy Using Docker

After [unsuccessfully spending some time to try to make Azure App Service work again](./../2018.deploy-to-azure-web-app/2018.deploy-to-azure-web-app.md), I wonder if deployment via Docker is the easier alternative.

+ Since I have not used Docker before, I start with the basics, read the guide from https://docs.docker.com/engine/examples/dotnetcore/
+ Adapt the dockerfile from the guide:
```dockerfile
# Build dotnet build image
FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.2-sdk AS build-env
WORKDIR /app

# Copy everything and build
COPY . ./
WORKDIR /app/PersistentProcess.WebHost
RUN dotnet publish -c Debug -o out

# Build runtime image
FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.2-aspnetcore-runtime AS deploy-env

# Paths relative to the app entry which is placed in a subdirectory.
ENV APPSETTING_webAppConfigurationFilePath="./../web-app-config.zip"
ENV APPSETTING_processStoreDirectoryPath="./../process-store"

COPY --from=build-env /app/PersistentProcess.WebHost/out ./app/
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "./app/PersistentProcess.WebHost.dll"]

# ENV APPSETTING_adminRootPassword="password-for-kalmit-root"
```
+ The image built with the Dockerfile seems to work so far. To prepare this for operation, add the `web-app-config.zip` file. This can be done with a dockerfile as follows:
```dockerfile
FROM kalmit/kalmit-web-app AS deploy-env

WORKDIR /
COPY ./web-app-config.zip .
```
+ Build this and start a container:
```powershell
docker build . -t configured-image
docker run -p 80:80 --env "APPSETTING_adminRootPassword=secret" configured-image
```
+ (Alternatively, run a container directly from the base image `kalmit/kalmit-web-app` and add the `web-app-config.zip` file to the container using [`docker cp`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/))
+ Realize that the container state is kept when the container is stopped.
+ Test to confirm that the state of the process store can be backed up to the host and transferred to another container using [`docker cp`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/):
```powershell
docker cp old_container:/process-store ./backup-process-store
docker stop old_container

docker run -p 80:80 --env "APPSETTING_adminRootPassword=secret" your-image-name

docker exec new_container rm -rf ./process-store
docker exec new_container ls -rf ./process-store
ls: cannot access './process-store': No such file or directory

docker cp ./backup-process-store new_container:./process-store
docker exec new_container ls -rf ./process-store
.
reduction
composition
..

docker stop new_container
docker start new_container
```
+ This means I can go live without implementing a new storage interface first. 🍾
+ (Another way to reuse state in a new container is [docker commit](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/))
+ Since Elm works without adding a certificate, I assume the certificate used by Elm is coming with the integrated dotnet core image. Run a test to confirm this:
```powershell
docker run -it --rm microsoft/dotnet:aspnetcore-runtime
root@501d7ea5d732:/# awk -v cmd='openssl x509 -noout -subject' '
>      /BEGIN/{close(cmd)};{print | cmd}' < /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```
+ A portion from the output, containing the `DST Root CA X3` certificate used by Elm:
```powershell
[...]
subject=C = DE, O = D-Trust GmbH, CN = D-TRUST Root Class 3 CA 2 2009
subject=C = DE, O = D-Trust GmbH, CN = D-TRUST Root Class 3 CA 2 EV 2009
subject=O = Digital Signature Trust Co., CN = DST Root CA X3
subject=C = DE, O = Deutsche Telekom AG, OU = T-TeleSec Trust Center, CN = Deutsche Telekom Root CA 2
subject=C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.digicert.com, CN = DigiCert Assured ID Root CA
subject=C = US, O = DigiCert Inc, OU = www.digicert.com, CN = DigiCert Assured ID Root G2
[...]
```
+ Read the digitalocean tutorial on [How To Install and Use Docker on Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04). Using docker on digitalocean works without notable impediments. I fail using scp with PowerShell, find [WinSCP-5.13.7](https://winscp.net/download/WinSCP-5.13.7-Portable.zip) which works better.
